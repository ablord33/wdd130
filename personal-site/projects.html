      As an adept student in web development and computer programming at Brigham Young University-Idaho, Bright
      Ablordeppey undertook several remarkable projects that showcased his technical skills and innovative mindset. Here
      are a few notable examples: Interactive Portfolio Website: My creativity and web development skills converged in
      the creation of an interactive portfolio website. Leveraging my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frameworks
      like React or Angular,I designed a visually appealing and engaging website that effectively showcases my projects,
      skills, and achievements. The website incorporates animations, responsive layouts, and interactive elements to
      captivate visitors and leave a lasting impression.</p>
    <P>Also I demonstrated my proficiency in web development by creating a dynamic and user-friendly White Water Rafting
      website from scratch. I leveraged my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to design an intuitive interface and
      implement a secure booking gateway.</P>
